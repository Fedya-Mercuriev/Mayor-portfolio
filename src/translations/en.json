The visual implementation was driven by the inspiration of iOS smooth-moving elements, thus every tiny arrow, every list, title on this page appear, rotate as smooth as possible."

I had a game on my cellphone where you were given a target number, that you should get, initial number, a number of steps and available mathematical operations (\"+2\", \"/3\" etc.). Your goal was to get the target number using mathematical operations at a restricted number of steps.\nI wrote down the game features and implemented It using the programming language I was learning at that time. Unfortunately, not all features I managed to implement (ex: \"level switch\"). I’m planning to add level constructor in the near future."
