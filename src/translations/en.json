I chose cards to display the received data for they’re vivid, independent and elaborate. The visual implementation was driven by the inspiration of iOS smooth-moving elements, thus every tiny arrow, every list, title on this page appear, rotate as smooth as possible."

    "description": "It was the first serious project I’ve ever made – not just static page layouts, but also functionality implemented with js. I had a game on my cellphone where you were given a target number, that you should get, initial number, a number of steps and available mathematical operations (\"+2\", \"/3\" etc.). Your goal was to get the target number using mathematical operations at a restricted number of steps.\nI wrote down the game features and implemented It using the programming language I was learning at that time. Unfortunately, not all features I managed to implement (ex: \"level switch\"). I’m planning to add level constructor in the near future."

Material Design guide was used as a basis for component construction."
